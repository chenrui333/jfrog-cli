# Overview
JFrog CLI is a compact and smart client that provides a simple interface that automates access to *Artifactory*, *Bintray* and *Mission Control* through their respective REST APIs.
By using the JFrog CLI, you can greatly simplify your automation scripts making them more readable and easier to maintain.
Several features of the JFrog CLI makes your scripts more efficient and reliable:

- Multi-threaded upload and download of artifacts make builds run faster
- Checksum optimization reduces redundant file transfers
- Wildcards and regular expressions give you an easy way to collect all the artifacts you wish to upload or download.
- "Dry run" gives you a preview of file transfer operations before you actually run them

# Download and Installation

You can download the executable directly using the [JFrog CLI Download Page](https://www.jfrog.com/getcli/), or install it with npm, homebrew or docker.
## NPM
````
npm install jfrog-cli-go
````
## Homebrew
````
brew install jfrog-cli-go
````
## Docker
````
docker run docker.bintray.io/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go:latest jfrog <COMMAND>
````

# Building the Executable

JFrog CLI is written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), so to build the CLI yourself, you first need to have Go installed and configured on your machine.

## Install Go

To download and install `Go`, please refer to the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Please download `Go 1.13` or above.

## Download and Build the CLI

Navigate to a directory where you want to create the jfrog-cli-go project, **outside** the `$GOPATH` tree.

If the `GOPATH` variable is unset, it's default value is the go folder under the user home.

Verify that the `GO111MODULE` variable is either unset, or explicitly set to `auto`.

Clone the jfrog-cli-go project by executing the following command:
````
git clone https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go/
````
Build the project by navigating to the jfrog folder and executing the go build command:
````
cd jfrog-cli-go/jfrog/
go build
````
Once completed, you will find the JFrog CLI executable at your current directory.

# Tests

### Artifactory tests
#### General tests
To run Artifactory tests execute the following command:
````
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go
````
Optional flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-rt.url` | [Default: http://localhost:8081/artifactory] Artifactory URL. |
| `-rt.user` | [Default: admin] Artifactory username. |
| `-rt.password` | [Default: password] Artifactory password. |
| `-rt.apikey` | [Optional] Artifactory API key. |
| `-rt.sshKeyPath` | [Optional] Ssh key file path. Should be used only if the Artifactory URL format is ssh://[domain]:port |
| `-rt.sshPassphrase` | [Optional] Ssh key passphrase. |
| `-rt.accessToken` | [Optional] Artifactory access token. |


* Running the tests will create two repositories: `jfrog-cli-tests-repo` and `jfrog-cli-tests-repo1`.<br/>
  Once the tests are completed, the content of these repositories will be deleted.

#### Maven, Gradle and Npm tests
* The *M2_HOME* environment variable should be set to the local maven installation path.
* The *gradle* and *npm* executables should be included as part of the *PATH* environment variable.
* The *java* executable should be included as part of the *PATH* environment variable. Alternatively, set the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable.

To run build tools tests execute the following command:
````
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go -test.artifactory=false -test.buildTools=true
````
##### Limitation
* Currently, build integration support only http(s) connections to Artifactory using username and password.

#### Docker push test

To run docker push tests execute the following command (fill out the missing parameters as described below):
````
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go -test.artifactory=false -test.docker=true -rt.dockerRepoDomain=DOCKER_DOMAIN -rt.dockerTargetRepo=DOCKER_TARGET_REPO -rt.url=ARTIFACTORY_URL -rt.user=USERNAME -rt.password=PASSWORD
````

##### Mandatory Parameters
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-rt.dockerRepoDomain` | Artifactory Docker registry domain. |
| `-rt.dockerTargetRepo` | Artifactory Docker repository name. |
| `-rt.url` | Artifactory URL. |
| `-rt.user` | Artifactory username. |
| `-rt.password` | Artifactory password. |

#### Go commands tests

To run go tests:
* Use Go version 1.13 and above.
* Run the following command:

````

````

#### NuGet tests

To run NuGet tests:
* Add NuGet executable to the system search path (PATH environment variable).
* Create a remote repository named jfrog-cli-tests-nuget-remote-repo
* Run the following command:

````
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go -test.artifactory=false -test.nuget=true
````

### Bintray tests
Bintray tests credentials are taken from the CLI configuration. If non configured or not passed as flags, the tests will fail.

To run Bintray tests execute the following command:
````
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go -test.artifactory=false -test.bintray=true
````
Flags:

| Flag | Description |

| `-bt.user` | [Mandatory if not configured] Bintray username. |
| `-bt.key` | [Mandatory if not configured] Bintray API key. |
| `-bt.org` | [Optional] Bintray organization. If not configured, *-bt.user* is used as the organization name. |

* Running the tests will create a repository `jfrog-cli-tests-repo1` in bintray.<br/>
  Once the tests are completed, the repository will be deleted.
